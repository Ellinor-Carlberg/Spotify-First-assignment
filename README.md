# Spotify-First-assignment
Imitate a other webpage


This was our first home assignment in school. It was during the course HTML and CSS. We worked 2 people on this task.

In this task we would recreate a website's structure, design and responsiveness. We would not focus on interactivity, but instead we would place all focus on imitating the visual with a focus on responsiveness.

We did not get the text in the header to change color when scrolling, because we had not learned how to do it.

I worked on this assignment with Camilla Johansson https://github.com/millifrill
She has done the part we call section 2 and section 3 we worked on together.
